# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The project involves analyzing credit card risk using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

The project has several deliverables:

1. Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
   - In this deliverable, you will use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, as well as the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm, to resample the dataset.
   - The logistic regression classifier will be trained, and the balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report will be calculated.

2. Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
   - This deliverable focuses on using the SMOTEENN algorithm, which combines over- and undersampling techniques, to resample the dataset.
   - The logistic regression classifier will be trained, and the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report will be generated.

3. Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
   - In this deliverable, you will train and compare two ensemble classifiers, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
   - Resampling techniques will be applied, and the ensemble classifiers will be trained. The balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report will be generated.
